      <description>Over several years of reading dev logs, articles and experiences of individuals, I see immense value in these kinds of sites.
It serves as a timecapsule for an experience. Maybe training data for some GPT, who knows.
But for me, I want to start dumping my ideas, discovery (maybe niche or well known to others but new to me) into this dev/strictly my opinion style content.
Hence the Initial commit. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to maintain this and add content as and when inspiration hits, just for myself and for the satisfaction that someone out there might appreciate.</description>
