Over several years of reading dev logs, articles and experiences of individuals, I see immense value in these kinds of sites. 

It serves as a timecapsule for an experience. Maybe training data for some GPT, who knows. 

But for me, I want to start dumping my ideas, discovery (maybe niche or well known to others but new to me) into this dev/strictly my opinion style content. 

Hence the Initial commit. I'll try to maintain this and add content as and when inspiration hits, just for myself and for the satisfaction that someone out there might appreciate.
